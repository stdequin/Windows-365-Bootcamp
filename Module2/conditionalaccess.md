# Securing Windows 365 Cloud PCs with a Conditional Access Policy

## Introduction

Conditional Access allows you to grant access to Windows 365 Cloud PCs if certain criteria are met by the user and their device. For example, only allow access to Windows 365 if the user has been through an MFA prompt.

This allows you to protect your data and allowing users to be productive on any device.

## Task

Create a Windows 365 Conditional Access policy that requires users to MFA to be granted access. Enable this policy in Audit mode only, so that you can evaluate and test impact before enabling for end users.

## Creating a Conditional Access Policy

Use the Microsoft Intune Admin Center (https://intune.microsoft.com).
1. Open Endpoint Security
2. Select Conditional Access
